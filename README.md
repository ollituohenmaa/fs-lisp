A really simple Lisp interpreter, mostly based on Peter Norvig's article "[(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](http://norvig.com/lispy.html)".

The [browser REPL](https://ollituohenmaa.github.io/fs-lisp/) is built with [Fable](https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable) and [Feliz](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Feliz). Everything else is plain F#. The REPL color theme is [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/).
